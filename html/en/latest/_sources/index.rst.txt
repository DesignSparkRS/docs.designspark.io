DesignSpark Documentation Library
#################################

The DesignSpark Documentation Library is used to host technical reference documentation for DesignSpark Cloud and collaborative open source projects. Documentation is written in reStructuredText (RST), hosted in GitHub repositories and generated using Sphinx, which makes it easier to update, manage and release documentation alongside code, using a "continous documentation" paradigm.

Should you identify a mistake or otherwise room for improvement, a pull request can be submitted using the *Edit on GitHub* link top-right of the page in question.

.. note::
   Documentation which is not hosted as part of the main docs project and instead in a GitHub repository alongside code or PCB design files, is published under :code:`/projects/`. When navigating to such "sub-projects", the site navigation will change to that of the sub-project. This can be a little confusing at first, but the browser *Back* button can be used to return to the main documentation site.
