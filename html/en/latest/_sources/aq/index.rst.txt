Air Quality Project
###################

Air quality is a growing problem worldwide. DesignSpark has developed an open-source, cloud-connected, sensor platform as part of a wider programme of engineer activism. You can find out more about this and the contributor community via the `DesignSpark website`_. 

In the left-hand navigation you can find links for the Air Quality Project technical reference documentation.
