Taxonomy
########

An taxonomy is being developed so as to ensure consistency in the labelling of
data gathered and avoid multiple labels being used for the same thing. 

Should it be neccessary to extend the taxonomy, e.g. to add a missing location,
there are two routes to achieving this:

#. Submit a pull request to modify this page (see Edit on GitHub link top-right)
#. Raise a `support ticket`_ (Air Quality Project - Cloud Support)
